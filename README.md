## Deta Space

[Deta Space](https://deta.space/developers) is a personal computer that lives in the cloud — a _personal cloud_. When you install an app, you get a personal copy. The data that app saves to your Space is for you: explore it, extend it, export it. Apps and data in your Space can easily integrate — powered by the personal cloud. Everything on the personal cloud is programmable.

This app is built using Space and Deta infrastructure. You can fork it, clone it, change it, deploy it, or just install it.

## Development

This app is developed using:

- [Remix](https://remix.run/): framework to create modern, resilient apps
- [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [tailwindui](https://tailwindui.com/): utility-first CSS framework
- [Deta Space](https://deta.space/docs/en/introduction/app-anatomy): deployment and authentication
- [Deta Base](https://deta.space/docs/en/basics/data#base): database to store links and analytics

### Local development

Fork it, clone it, run remix.

From your terminal:

```sh
npm run dev
```

This starts your app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes.

In order to store data in the Base, you will need to set your Deta dev key in your `.env` file (copy `.env.example`):

```
DETA_PROJECT_KEY=<put_your_project_key_here>
```

Learn how to manage your Deta keys in [Developing with Base and Drive – Space Docs](https://deta.space/docs/en/basics/data#developing-with-base-and-drive).

### Deployment

If you want to deploy a different version of this app on Deta Space, follow the [deployment docs](https://deta.space/docs/en/basics/revisions). Otherwise, just [install it](#deta-space).

First, create your space project:

```sh
space new
```

Then push to space:

```sh
space push
```
